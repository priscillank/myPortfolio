      <p class="aboutname-desktop">My name is <br> <span class="myName-about">Priscilla Nishiyama Kohlman</span>
        and I'm an average girl.</p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <p> <span class="about-bold">I was born in São Paulo, Brazil</span>
        to a Korean mom and a Japanese dad. When I was roughly seven years old, my parents decided to move to the states and I found myself in Tennessee. It wasn’t long before I picked up English and started adapting to my surroundings. Life was good.
        <br><br>
        That’s probably the exact reason why my family decided to move to Georgia. <i>Priscilla is getting too comfortable here. Let’s kick up the difficulty level and make her cry.</i> I'm partially convinced that’s exactly what they were thinking. It had nothing to do with the better schooling district and safer community.
        <br><br>
        Jokes aside, it was a little harder to move schools in the middle of 7th grade. So in addition to puberty, my teenage angst was at an all time high. Desperate for an outlet, I began blogging on a website called Xanga. I spent most of the time customizing and “coding” layouts instead of actually blogging. It wasn’t long before Myspace came around and I found myself another platform to tinker with. After a while, I began creating layouts for other people.</p>

<div class="bg-color-pink">
  <div class="about container1">
    <p><span class="about-bold">My most memorable iterations</span> included designs without a “Top 8” section. I despised the concept of ranking my friends in a list and the unnecessary drama that came along with it. I figured it was a me problem so I kept that list hidden exclusively on my personal site. Still, it wasn’t long before I was bombarded with messages asking me how I did it and if I could pump out similar layouts. While I enjoyed creating content for others, the solution to remove that section was created to solve my problem and enhance my experience with the platform.
      <br><br>
      Fast forward to the future, my focus shifted to creating meaningful solutions <b>for others.</b> While working as a bartender, it was my job to ensure guests with a positive experience by fulfilling their needs and expectations. My ability to empathize helped me to better understand my customer base. I found satisfaction in providing quality service and receiving positive feedback. And though I found great value in my line of work, I longed for something a bit more fulfilling.</p>

<div class="about container1">
  <p><span class="about-bold">That’s where UX design comes into the picture.</span>  It encompasses my passion for empathizing with people, my creativity for problem-solving, and my ability to apply art processes to further enhance UX design. My experiences give me a unique approach for coming up with solutions for others. People are able to do amazing things with the help of technology <b>when it is designed to work for them.</b> I want to help bridge the gap between humans and technology which, in turn, should yield amazing results.</p>
