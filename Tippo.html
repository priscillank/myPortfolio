              <p> I was able to identify standard features and design patterns that users are accustomed to when tracking tips or data.
The apps designed to track tips included all of the key features mentioned in the surveys however they weren’t intuitive to use and had dated visual designs which lead to a lack of credibility. I was honestly shocked at how poorly designed these apps were and they're somehow highly rated in the app markets.
<br><br>Google Sheets, on the other hand, was very easy to use but wasn’t specifically catered for a tipped worker.

    <div class="col1-projectb">
      <p>With the user stories and flows completed, I had a better idea of how to structure my wireframes based on hierarchy. I created and tested several rounds of paper prototypes before creating digital wireframes.
<br><br>
Establishing the wireframes was the most challenging phase during this process. It was difficult to implement customizable tip options for every job, position, and shift in a way that was intuitive for the user.

        <div class="col2-projectb">
<p>The first design based on my content strategy and site map completely failed. During my first usability test, a few participants didn’t understand why there were such extensive customizable features. Many struggled with how the “Jobs” page was laid out and had difficulty understanding what they were customizing. Additionally, a few mentioned these features were typically found under “Settings” and it felt unnatural in a place other than “User/Account”.
<br><br>
To clarify, I initially wanted users to have the ability to input their Job (employer) and their position(s) (bartender, server, busboy, etc). In most cases, they are all tipped differently and I wanted users to have the ability to customize their data and/or notifications. Even while sketching out concepts, I was frustrated with how I could lay the information out in a way that was easy for the user to understand.
I couldn’t draw inspiration from similar apps for design patterns as they weren’t intuitive either.
<br><br>

I later realized that the idea of extensive customization came from TipSee and Just the Tips. The research gathered showed no indication that this was a necessary feature.</p>

          <p>    After my first usability test, I spent some time looking through design patterns and features in different apps. I was able to draw inspiration from Google Drive, Otter, Headspace and Uber .
<br><br>
          Using the feedback gathered from before, I worked on simplifying the product altogether, adding an account setup, and getting rid of the extensive customizable options. I was heavily inspired by Uber and implemented swiping the bottom drawer up for advanced options.
<br><br>
          While testing the second prototype, I changed tasks slightly according to the revisions:<br><br>
          1. Create an account.<br>
2. Add a detailed tip, meaning one that includes both cash and credit card.<br>
3. Create a new job for your account.<br>
4. View a detailed income report from 02/09 - 02/15.<br>
5. Export your data.<br><br>
Participants successfully completed all five tasks and I was able to move my designs to Figma.

<p>I went with an analogous color palette using shades of blue and a pop of bright green. The product primarily uses a dark, navy blue to evoke a sense of reliability and strength. The bright pop green serves to bring an energizing and vibrant energy to the otherwise plain UI.</p>

      <h3>High Fidelity Mockups</h3>
    </div>

      <div class="col2-projectb">
  <p>After establishing my product’s brand and curating a style guide, I was able to work on designing my high-fidelity mockup screens.
<br><br>
It took me a couple of rounds of iteration and feedback before finalizing the mockups. The changes made in the first and second rounds were implemented after a senior designer looked over my screens and suggested revisions in order to further leverage the visuals. The revisions made on the third round were implemented after running usability tests.</p>

1. Changed colors on buttons to better indicate they were disabled.<br>
2. Added the signature green color to other sections of the app to add cohesion to the screens and to also guide users towards important features/tasks<br><br>

In addition to the color changes, I took out some of the line dividers on the side menu to add dimension to the page.</p>

          <p><b>Usability Testing</b><br><br>

I assigned participants of the usability tests with the same tasks used to create my second round of paper prototypes:
<br><br>
1. Create an account.<br>
2. Add a detailed tip, meaning one that includes both cash and credit card.<br>
3. Create a new job for your account.<br>
4. View a detailed income report from 02/09 - 02/15.<br>
5. Export your data.<br><br>

When tasked with creating a new job, several participants initially clicked on the “Add” tab on the bottom navigation. After further exploration, they would successfully complete the task on the side menu.
<br><br>
Additionally, participants were confused with the option to “Enable” a job. Again, I was drawing inspiration from the competitors’ apps because I found that a majority of them had that feature. Admittedly, I wasn’t sure of its exact purpose even after further research. I could only make assumptions.
<br><br>
Due to the confusion, I got rid of the ambiguous feature and implemented the “Primary Job” option for autofill purposes when adding a tip. I added in an explanation under the box for further clarification.
<br><br>
<b>Revisions:</b><br>
1. Added a drop-down menu for jobs on all of the tip input fields<br>
2. Removed the “Enabled” switch button on the “Create Job” screen and changed it to a checkbox option to indicate a primary job, meaning which job is auto filled when trying to input a tip.

            When tasked with viewing a detailed income report, participants pointed out that it was difficult to differentiate the headings for the graphs, customizable time periods when viewing reports would be beneficial, and the green color on the segmented controls were confusing as it usually indicated clickability/action.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, all participants tried to export data from the Reports tab.
            <br><br>
            <b>Revisions:</b><br>
            1. As opposed to three different sections for Total Income in the Reports tab, I opted for only one graph at a time with customizable options for the time period.<br>
            2. Changed the color on the segmented controls to the blue accent color.<br>
            3. Implemented an additional method of exporting data in the Reports tab.<br>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="col2-projectb">
        <p>As I have worked a tipped position for the last ten years, I figured I had first hand experience on what was needed to create this product. It only took one round of usability testing for me to realize how wrong I was.
<br><br>
I heavily relied on my usability testing results when creating different iterations of the product as there weren’t many similar apps to draw design inspiration from. In fact, the features I attempted to emulate from competitor apps all failed during my tests, in particular the extensive customizable options.
<br><br>
Much like my other projects, this was a very humbling experience and I have learned how important usability testing can be. </p>
